_Python and DragonRealms_

Its a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo)!

## Projects

These are hobby projects. None of them are in a state to deploy to users; I'm just having fun recreating/creating stuff in Python that's mostly been written in Ruby. 

* client: Aims to be a lich clone with a terminal and graphical based front end written in Python
* beholder: A browser-based dashboarding application showing character experience gains in real time. It uses lich, redis, sqlite and dash-plotly to pipeline data to the browser. 
* chat: A stand-alone chat client for LNet. I basically just rewrote Etreu's Genie plugin in Python >.>
